        <br><br>

When a number of web pages are combined under a domain name, a website is formed. The World Wide Web was developed by Sir Tim Berners Lee at CERN, Switzerland. It is also called the internet. The www is not under the control of any one country or organization. It functions as a shared network of computers. Large computers, called servers, are used to send and store information for the www. Huge server farms have been built just for this purpose.
